    "There's nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think about what it is that you want in your life, and why.",

    "You make one step backward, one slipup, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won\u2019t have to worry about your destiny anymore; because I\u2019ll make sure your destiny ends, right then and there, permanently.",
    "You sound like my nephew, always thinking you need to do things on your own without anyone\u2019s support. There is nothing wrong with letting the people who love you help you.",
    "But now you\u2019re not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won\u2019t stop caring.",
    "My own mother thought I was a monster\u2026 She was right of course, but it still hurt.",
    "No, it's not. Look, Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out. Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again...you have to try every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you\u00a0*might*\u00a0fail.",

    "I know how to deal with these guys, Katara. Pirates love to haggle. Watch and learn. What say ye to the price of... one copper piece!",
    "So, this the great Avatar, master of all the elements. I don't know\u00a0how\u00a0you managed to elude the Fire Nation for a hundred years. But your little game of hideandseek... is over.",
    "You're being too hard on yourself. Even if you did run away, I think it was meant to be. If you stayed, you would have been killed with all the other airbenders.",

    "No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it; one minute she wants to go out with me, the next she's telling me to get lost! So, how's waterbending training?",
    "Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku. That way, you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending. Everyone's happy!",
    "I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes. Now, I must do it once again. You\u00a0will\u00a0teach the Avatar firebending.",
    "\u00a0I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training, meditating...you're just a child!",
    "Aang, I know you're upset, and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love! I went through the same thing when I lost my mom! Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family! Sokka and I, we're your family now!",
    "My business is\u00a0my\u00a0business young man and none of yours! I've got a good mind to put you over my knee and paddle your backside!",
    "Name's Bonzu Pippinpaddleopsicopolis, The Third. And these are my grandchildren.",
    "The one that used to be the bad chamber, until the recent refurbishing that is. Of course, we've been calling it the new chamber, but we really should number them. Uh, take them to the refurbished chamber that was once bad!",
    "After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight, Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.",
    "Well, then maybe you should worry less about the tides, who've already made up their mind about killing you, and worry more about\u00a0me, who's still mulling it over.",
    "These are pakui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade plant. That, or makaola berries that cause blindness.",
    "What?! I'm saying I'd rather kiss you than die! That's a compliment!",
    "Well, technically there are eighty five, but let's just focus on the third. Neutral jing is the key to Earthbending. It involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike.",
    "Sure. You think you're any different from me, or your friends, or this tree? If you listen hard enough, you can hear every living thing breathing together. You can feel everything growing. We're all living together, even if most folks don't act like it. We all have the same roots, and we are all branches of the same tree.",
    "In the swamp, we see visions of people we've lost, people we loved, folks we think are gone. But the swamp tells us they're not. We're still connected to 'em. Time is an illusion, and so is death.",
    "You dare suggest I betray Iroh, my first born, directly after the demise of his only beloved son?! I think that Iroh has suffered enough. But you, your punishment has scarcely begun!",
    "No Aang! By choosing attachment you have locked the chakra! If you leave now, you won't be able to enter the Avatar State at all!",
    "You are not the man you used to be Zuko. You are stronger, and wiser, and freer than you have ever been! And now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny. It's time for you to choose. It's time for you to choose \"good.\"",
    "You still don't know who I am? You don't see the family resemblance? Let me give you a hint. (covers left eye with her hand, imitating Zuko) I must find the Avatar to restore my honor!",
    "Lightning is a pure expression of firebending, without aggression. It is not fueled by rage or emotion, the way other firebending is. Some call lightning \"the coldblooded fire.\"It is precise and deadly, like Azula. To perform the technique requires peace of mind.",
    "You think you're the first person to believe their war was justified?! Countless others before you have come here, seeking weapons, weaknesses or battle strategies!",
    "It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.",
    "Hey don't jinx it! We could still be attacked by some giant, exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp.",
    "I was just about to ask you the same thing. What do you plan to do now that you've found the Avatar's bison? Keep it locked in our new apartment? Should I go put on a pot of tea for him?!",
    "Well, I met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the Avatar State and control this great power. But to do it, I had to let go of someone I love... and I just couldn't.",
    "It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him, and I know the world needs him but doesn't he know how much that we need him too? How could he just leave us behind?!",
    "I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day I was gone, and every night, when I went to sleep, I would lie awake missing you so much it would ache.",
    "If anyone is to blame for the state of the world, it is me. I should have seen this war coming, and prevented it. You inherited my problems...and my mistakes. But I believe you are destined to redeem me, and save the world",
    "Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kinda cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut!",
    "Mr. and Mrs.... Fire, your son has been enrolled here for two days, and he's already causing problems. He's argued with his history teacher, disrupted music class, and roughed up my star pupil.",
    "Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If anything, their story proves anyone is capable of great good and great evil. Everyone, even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation, have to be treated like they're worth giving a chance. And I think it was about friendships too.",
    "Speaking of that third eyed freak, I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you guys think of (dramatic pause) Sparky Sparky Boom Man! (Everyone just stares) Just think about.",
    "I'm seeing everything so clearly now, what really matters, why I'm really doing this, I'm doing it to save the world, but more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love. I'm doing it for you, Katara.",
    "Coward! You may think that you're brave enough to face me, but you'll only do it during the Eclipse. If you have any real courage, you'll stick around until the sun comes out. Don't you want to hear what happened to your mother?",
    "Perhaps.... Now I realize that banishment is far to merciful a penalty for treason. Your penalty will be far steeper.... (The eclipse ends, and Ozai strikes Zuko with lightning, only for Zuko to direct it back to him, knocking Ozai off his feet)",
    "I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated. I love Zuko more than I fear you.",
    "Oh everyone trusts you now? I was the first person to trust you, remember? Back in Ba Sing Se. And you turned around and betrayed me. Betrayed all of us!",
    "But for me, it takes all the mistakes I have made in my life and shoves them back in my face. My uncle. He's always been on my side even when thing were bad. He was there for me. He taught me so much. And how do I repay him? With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret and I may never get to redeem myself.",
    "Personally, I don't really see the difference, but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to stop Chin. I offer you this wisdom, Aang, only justice will bring peace.",
    "You should count yourself lucky that the Avatar spared your life. Banishing me was they best thing you did for my life. It put me on the right path. Perhaps your time in here could do the same for you.",
    "[in the Avatar State, with the voice of the previous Avatars] Fire Lord Ozai, you and your forefathers have devastated the balance of this world. And now, you shall pay the ultimate price!",
    "You know, Zuko. I don't care what everyone else says about you, you're pretty smart.",
    "\u00a0I needed to understand what real suffering was, so I could become more compassionate to others.\u00a0",
    "When you base your expectations only on what you see, you blind yourself to the possibilities of a new reality.",
    "Right, that's what you said... You know, it's okay to be scared, the whole city is frightened by what's been going on. The important thing is to talk about our fears, because if we don't, they can throw us out of balance. I'm always here for you, if you want to talk.",
    "All I'm trying to do is help. Think back, fortytwo years ago, Republic City was threatened by another dangerous man. Yakone. Your father wasn't afraid to deal with him head on.",
    "My father and I searched for days, but we never found a sign of Noatak. We thought he perished in that storm. My mother was never the same after the loss of my brother My father stopped training me. With Noatak gone, his hopes for revenge withered. And he passed away, a few years later.",
    "Avatar Korra. I am truly sorry for all that I did to you. I thought I was better than my father, but his ghost still shaped me. I became a soldier of revenge, just like he wanted me to be. And so did my brother. The revolution may be built on a lie, but I think Amon truly believes bending is the source of all evil in the world.",
    "This whole time, Amon has been one step ahead of us. But finally we have the advantage. We know the truth about him. If we expose him as a bender in front of all his supporters...",
    "It's so crazy. A few months ago I was in the South Pole practicing for my firebending test, and now I'm in the middle of an allout war.",
    "And ever since you were a little girl, you've excelled at the physical side of bending and completely ignored the spiritual side. The Avatar must master both.",
    "Young man, it is nothing to be ashamed of. I too came from humble beginnings. Why, when I was your age I was a real shoeshiner and all I had to my name was an idea: The Sato Mobile. Now I was fortunate enough to meet someone who believed in me and my work ethic. He gave me the money I needed to get my idea of the ground and I build the entire Future Industries empire from that one selfless loan.",
    "It's alright. People usually assume that I'm Daddy's helpless little girl but I can handle myself. I mean I've been in selfdefense classes since I was this high. My dad made sure I would always be able to protect myself.",
    "\u00a0Under normal circumstances I wouldn't get involved, but if what those victims said is true, we\u2019re not dealing with a normal criminal.",
    "You're not, in fact, the Avatar. You're merely a halfbaked Avatar in training. Which reminds me, how is your airbending going? Made any significant progress?",
    "Don't hold your breath, bub. You know, Tenzin's been right about you all along. You played me, you played Beifong, and now you're playing the new Chief, too. Well, I got news for you. You need me, but I don't need you. I'm the Avatar.",
    "Well, well, well, if it isn't the Fire Ferrets. Probending's saddest excuse for a team. Tell me, how'd a couple of amateurs like you luck their way into the tournament? Especially you, uhvatar. You know, if you'd like to learn how a real pro bends, I could give you some private lessons.",
    "What? Listen to you two. I'm not interested in Mako or any romantic stuff. Besides he's all into that prissy, beautiful, elegant rich girl. But let's just pretend for a second I am interested in him; What would I do?",
    "Korra and I are perfect for each other. She's strong, I'm strong. She's fun, I'm fun. She's beautiful, I'm gorgeous!",
    "No! No! No! The best way to win a boy's heart is to brew a love potion of rainbows and sunsets that\u00a0makes true lovers sprout wings and fly to a magical castle in the sky where they get married and eat clouds with spoons and use stars as ice cubes in their moonlight punch for ever and ever and EVER",
    "\u00a0What are you going to do about it? You're the weak one. You always say bloodbending is the most powerful thing in the world, but it isn't. The Avatar is. He took your bending away. What could be more powerful than that?",
    "Yes. There used to be lights in the South as well. But during the Hundred Year War, the South was thrown out of balance, and the lights disappeared. When the war ended, the North helped to rebuild you physically as a nation. But we have not rebuilt you spiritually. Now the spirits no longer dance in your skies. Instead, they rampage in the Everstorm.",
    "Rhetorical question, Zhu Li. You gotta keep up. Not to mention I've got a cargo ship full of Halibut that's rotting, thanks to this harbor lockdown. Who wants to buy a ship full of stinking fish? Seriously, it's not rhetorical. I need to sell these fish.",
    "No, he wants control of our wealth. My wealth. And I like my wealth. If Unalaq doesn't pull his forces out, then we have no choice but to fight for our freedom!",
    "Yes. My name is Raava. That spirit you freed is Vaatu. He is the force of darkness and chaos. I am the force of light and peace. Since the beginning of time, we have battled for the fate of this world, and for the past\u00a0ten thousand years, I have kept darkness under control and the world in balance. Until\u00a0*you*\u00a0came along.",
    "I am Zhao the Conqueror! I am the Moonslayer! I will capture the Avatar! I am Zhao the Conqueror! I am the Moonslayer! I will capture the Avatar!",
    "The fog of lost souls is a spirit prison for humans. I read about it in an ancient text. The fog is actually a spirit... that infects your mind and slowly drives you mad, imprisoning you in your own darkest memories.",
    "Sounds like you're carrying around your former enemies. The same way you're still carrying around that metal poison. You ever consider maybe you could learn something from them?",
    "Why? So I can sit around and meditate about how bad I am at airbending? You know, I'm beginning to think there's a reason I haven't been able to learn it! Because, maybe, I don't even need it!",
    "I expected this kind of cutandrun response from Tenzin. But the rest of you? Come on, show a little more backbone. It's time that the benders of this city displayed some strength and unity against these Equalists.",
    "It is hard to argue with Chief Beifong's track record. If she is confident her elite officers can protect the arena, then she has my support. I am changing my vote. Who else is with me? The arena stays open. Good luck in the finals.",
    "Thank you all for joining me on this historic occasion. When I was a boy, a firebender struck down my entire family and left me scarred. That, tragic event began my quest to equalize the world.",
    "I was his son, but in order to win Republic City, I had to become someone else. My father failed because he tried to rule the city from its rotten underbelly. My plan was perfect. I was to be the city's savior. But you, you ruined everything!",
    "The Avatar stole it from me. That's why I brought you out here, to learn your destiny. You two will become bloodbenders of the highest order. When the time is right, you will claim Republic City and you will destroy the Avatar. You must avenge me. That is your purpose in life.",
    "I have a couple of questions. Is this an all vegetarian island? Is that where you train airbending? Do we have to wear Air Acolyte clothes? Do we each get our own sky bison? And final question, how many trees are on this island?",
    "Look, I know I wasn't a great mother, but one way or another, I ended up with two great kids. Good enough to risk my bony old butt for, anyway. If you can just find some way not to hate me, maybe that's enough, at least for me.",
    "The War of the Water Tribes is over. Unalaq has been defeated, and the Northern Fleet is returning home. The Water Tribes will always be allies, but the Southern Tribe is now independent, and the Southern Council of Elders has appointed my father, Tonraq, to be your new chief.",
    "I learned that the idea of a royal family passing a title from one generation to the next was archaic, and that technology and innovation should be what drives a nation forward. It was the pathetic rule of kings and queens that caused the Earth Kingdom to descend into such incredible disarray. It's taken me three years to get it back on track, and there is no way I will allow it to slip back into the dark ages.",
    "Guru Lahima lived 4000 years ago in the Northern Air Temple. It is said that he unlocked the secrets of weightlessness and became untethered from the earth, living his final 40 years without ever touching the ground.",
    "Now you might wanna ration that bowl of rice, you've got three weeks until the next shift change. It's the dawning of a new age, the end of the White Lotus, and soon, the end of the Avatar.",
    "No! This can't be. Do you have any idea the power these criminals possess? Individually, they can take down any bender. Put them all together, they could take down the entire world. And now you're telling me their leader is an airbender?",
    "We built this place secretly with your father to hold a very special prisoner. She's a powerful firebender named P'Li who can create explosions with her mind. Ironically, I hired a guy with a similar ability to kill the Avatar myself once. [awkward pause] Didn't work.",
    "You make me do your dirty work extorting your own citizens for your stupid palaces and topiaries, and then you just want to send me away? We're not going anywhere until we find some airbenders! We know there are some here!",
    "Shortly after we found out you were the Avatar, Zaheer and three others attempted to kidnap you. Luckily, your father, Lord Zuko, Chief Sokka, and I were there to stop them. We apprehended the criminals and locked them away in prisons designed to impair their abilities.",
    "These airbenders are Earth Kingdom citizens, and I am their queen. Taking them will constitute an act of war. If you disobey me, I will bear down on you with the entire force of my kingdom!",
    "We don't need to track them. I know exactly where they're going. Notify the new chiefs of the Northern Water Tribe that an attack on their prison is imminent. And send word to Lin Beifong in Republic City. The Avatar must be protected.",
    "Don't pretend you know what it felt like. The Avatar is adored by millions! I was cast aside by my own parents, like I meant nothing to them! How could I just stand by and watch the same thing happen to my nation when it needed someone to guide it?"
